# FLL Presentation - GitHub Repository Talking Points

## Version 1 (Straightforward)
"To share our code with other FLL teams, we posted our mission management system on GitHub. It's open-source, which means any team can use it for free. Our toolkit helps teams who are learning Python for the first time organize their robot missions without getting stuck on complicated setup."

## Version 2 (Conversational)
"We put our mission management system on GitHub so we could share it with each other and other FLL teams. It's open-source, so anyone can use it. We built it to help teams that are new to Python get their robot missions organized without wasting time on tricky setup stuff."

## Version 3 (Impact-focused)
"We made our code open-source on GitHub so any FLL team can use it. Our mission management system helps teams who are just starting with Python spend less time on confusing setup and more time actually programming their robot."
